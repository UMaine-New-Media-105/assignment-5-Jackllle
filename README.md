In this assignment we made a simulation game involving breeders and consumers. I chose monkeys that multiplied everytime they consumed 8 bananas. The first assignment I made circles and figured out how they would move. Then in the next assignment I changed the shape and added 50. In the third part of this assignment I had to create an enviroment with particle effects that made the game feel more real and interesting, I chose fireflys. In the 4th part of assignment I added my breeders so I actually had to add the Monkeys as well as the Bananas. In the Final part of the assignment I created hunters, they are very basic, but I am honestly at my witts end I have worked on this for so long. I just gave the hunters pilgrims hats, anyway I hope you enjoyed my final assignment, thank you for the semester!
